## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Simulated signal generation with configurable frequencies/amplitudes
- Real-time FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) processing
- Adaptive sampling frequency based on peak frequency
- Aggregation of sensor data over time windows
- WiFi and MQTT integration to publish average values
- Support for LoRa (EU868) transmission
- OLED display support (optional)
- Thread-safe logging using semaphores
